            <h1>Cognitive Contribution License (CCL)</h1>
            <p>A simple tool for declaring how much AI contributed to your project.</p>

                <h2>About the Project</h2>
                <p>
                    The Cognitive Contribution License (CCL) helps students, researchers, and creators transparently document the role of artificial intelligence across all stages of their work. Inspired by the spirit of Creative Commons, the CCL promotes honest reflection, responsible use of AI, and clarity in collaborative, tech-assisted creation.
                </p>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>What does it do?</h2>
                <p>
                    Using a step-by-step interface, the CCL tool lets you:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Select how much AI was involved (0 to 4) in each of 8 project phases.</li>
                    <li>Generate a clear, shareable summary of AI involvement.</li>
                    <li>Create a personalized CCL badge that visualizes the contribution across the full process.</li>
                    <li>Download the badge and summary to use in your portfolio, thesis, GitHub repo, or final report.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Levels of AI Contribution</h2>
                <p>
                    The tool defines five levels of AI contribution:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Full Human Work:</strong> This phase was completed entirely by the student without AI assistance.</li>
                    <li><strong>AI for Insight:</strong> AI was used for research, inspiration, or brainstorming. The student crafted the final work.</li>
                    <li><strong>AI for Drafting:</strong> AI generated early outputs that were then edited or rebuilt by the student.</li>
                    <li><strong>AI as Co-Creator:</strong> An iterative collaboration between student and AI shaped the outcome together.</li>
                    <li><strong>AI as Driver:</strong> AI generated the majority of the content; the student curated and edited.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
